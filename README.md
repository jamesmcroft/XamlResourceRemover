# XamlResourceRemover

A tool for identifying resources from a collection of XAML files based on their default style or x:Key resources and removes them from a collection of other XAML files.

## CAUTION

This tool was built with a very specific purpose and it's advised that if you want to use this, that you modify the code to work for your specific scenarios.

I am not liable for you accidentally removing all the XAML resources from your project by running this tool.
